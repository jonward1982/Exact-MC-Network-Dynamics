% 
% Compute total recovery and infection rate from each state
% Elements in binary representation of S corresponds to the vertices 
% that change in transition rate given by corresponding element in qlist.

% M states, N vertices
[M,N]=size(qlist);

% Binary 
Sbin=dec2binvec(S,N);

% Convert binary to logical - true if infected
infected=logical(Sbin);

% Count those rates where the vertex is infected to get recoveries
qrec=zeros(M,N);
qrec(infected)=qlist(infected);
qrec=sum(qrec,2);

% Count those rates where the vertex is not infected to get infections
qinf=zeros(M,N);
qinf(~infected)=qlist(~infected);
